## Introduction

This repository houses various C programming practice problems and assignments that I've tackled as part of my coursework at NUCES. The exercises cover fundamental concepts, algorithms, data structures, and more.

I've structured the repository to make it easy to navigate and locate specific assignments or practice sets.

## Folder Structure

- **`Assignments/`**: Contains the code and documentation for Assignment 1.
- **`LeetCode/`**: Folder dedicated to LeetCode problems.
- **`Practice_Problems/`**: Includes multiple sub-folders with categorized practice problems.
  - **`Simple_Arithmetics/`**: Problems involving basic arithmetic operations.
  - **`Loops/`**: Problems specifically focused on loop structures.
  - **`Patterns/`**: Problems specifically focused on patterns/designs.
  - **`Arrays/`**: Practice problems related to arrays.
  - **`Pointers/`**: Problems involving pointers and memory management, etc.
- **`Projects/`**: Larger-scale projects implemented in C, each in its separate folder.

Feel free to explore these folders to delve into specific topics or assignments.
