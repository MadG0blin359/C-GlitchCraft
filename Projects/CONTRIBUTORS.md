## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **[Expensly]:** A comprehensive expense-tracking application designed to help users manage their finances efficiently. Expensly provides an intuitive user interface, allowing users to input and categorize their expenses, view spending patterns, and generate insightful reports for better financial decision-making.
- **[Program Flow Image Form]:** An image representation of the program flow, illustrating the sequence of actions and interactions within the software. This visual aid serves as a valuable resource for developers and collaborators to understand the logical flow of the program, helping in debugging, optimization, and overall comprehension of the system.
- **[Program Flow]:** A UML (Unified Modeling Language) representation detailing the flow of the program. This diagram visually depicts the various components, processes, and interactions within the software. It provides a high-level overview of the system's architecture, showcasing how different parts of the program interact with each other to achieve specific functionalities. This UML representation is instrumental in conveying the structural and behavioral aspects of the software to developers and stakeholders.
